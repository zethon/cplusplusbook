# Chapter 1

This chapter will discuss things like:


* Why the terminal?

Terminals are the rudimentary operations of a computer. In many ways you can think of the graphical user interface as a program that is launched from the command line. As a matter of fact this is exactly how Windows used to work back in the Windows 3.1 era. When you started your computer normally you were met with a black screen and a command line prompt. In order to get into Windows you would have to run "win.exe", which was just another program.

The reason we will start with command line is because it is the easiest way to get started. Before we can do GUI programming, we first need to learn the basics of a program, and of how a computer works in general.
